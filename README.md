# React Catch-up

React's API had not really changed much since its initial release in 2013. But, the beginning of 2018 marked a new chapter for React as it prepared our apps to benefit from the new "Fiber" architectureâ€”particularly async rendering.

This repository is designed to quickly catch you up on the React Changelog and all the new stuff. With a little guidance you'll see it's not overwhelming and get your app ready for the future of React.
